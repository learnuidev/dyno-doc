# Development & Deployment

Dyno consists of two components:

1. A Serverless NodeJS backend hosted on AWS
2. A FullStack NextJS Frontend

In this tutorial you will learn:

1. How to Deploy Serverless NodeJS Backend
2. How to Run NextJS Frontend Locally
3. How to Deploying NextJS Frontend to Vercel

Lets look at how we can deploy them

## Deploying Serverless NodeJS Backend

Clone the backend repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/learnuidev/dyno-api.git
```

Install Dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

Deploy

```bash
npx sls deploy
```

After deploying, you will need to go to Cognito and copy UserPool Id and UserPoolClient Id. This will be needed when running the frontend

## Running NextJS Frontend Locally

Populate `.env.local` file

```{{title: ".env.local"}}
# 1. AWS
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=

# 2. AWS Cognito
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_REGION=
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_COGNITO_USERPOOL_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_COGNITO_WEBCLIENT_ID=

# 3. Icions
# Option 1: Lucide (Free)
# NEXT_PUBIC_ICONS_TYPE=lucide

# Option 2: Font Awesome (paid)
NEXT_PUBIC_ICONS_TYPE=font-awesome
FONT_AWESOME_TOKEN=
```

Install Dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

Run Locally:

```bash
npm npm dev
```

## Deploying NextJS Frontend to Vercel

The recommended way to authenticate with the Protocol API is by using OAuth2. When establishing a connection using OAuth2, you will need your access token — you will find it in the [Protocol dashboard](#) under API settings. Here's how to add the token to the request header using cURL:

```bash {{ title: 'Example request with bearer token' }}
curl https://api.protocol.chat/v1/conversations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
```

Always keep your token safe and reset it if you suspect it has been compromised.

## Using an SDK

If you use one of our official SDKs, you won't have to worry about any of the above — fetch your access token from the [Protocol dashboard](#) under API settings, and the client library will take care of the rest. All the client libraries use OAuth2 behind the scenes.
